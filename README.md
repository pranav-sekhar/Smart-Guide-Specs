# Smart Guide Specs
Smart Guide Specs is a voice-assisted smart glass for visually impaired users integrating a camera with YOLO-based object detection (like table,mobile etc) and MediaPipe-based action recognition (like waving, walking etc) to identify surrounding objects and human activities, providing real-time voice feedback for improved navigation, situational awareness and overall independence in daily life. 

## Features
- Object detection using YOLO deep learning model
- Action recognition using MediaPipe
- Voice output to notify user of surrounding objects and actions
- Assistive design for visually impaired users 

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- YOLO (Object Detection)  
- MediaPipe (Action Detection)  
- OpenCV  
- Text-to-Speech
